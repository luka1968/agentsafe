"""Tiered audit pricing (advertised at request time, per TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md).

Prices are USD strings (x402 format) picked from the contract's verified
source size BEFORE payment verification, so the advertised payment
requirement always matches the real audit cost. The line count is derived
server-side from Etherscan's verified source; the client can never
influence the quoted tier.

Table (AgentLISA pricing):
    up to   100 source lines -> $0.50
    101 -   500 source lines -> $2.50
    501 - 1,000 source lines -> $5.00
    1,001 - 5,000 source lines -> $25.00
    over 5,000 -> custom pricing (request refused, contact link returned)
